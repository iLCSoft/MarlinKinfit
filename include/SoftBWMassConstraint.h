//  Class SoftBWMassConstraint:
/// Implements constraint 0 = mass1 - mass2 - m
/**
 * This class implements different mass constraints:
 * - the invariant mass of several objects should be m
 * - the difference of the invariant masses between two 
 *   sets of objects should be m (normally m=0 in this case).
